# Python for Everybody Specialization

## Goals </br> 

 - Complete the Python for Everybody Specialization

## Boundaries / Scope </br>

 - Complete Course 1 Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)</br>
 - Complete Course 2 Python Data Structures</br>
     		 
## Success criteria </br>

 - My own application for data retrieval and processing.
 - Weekly work log with screenshots and summaries to demonstrate activity.

## Constraints </br>

 - I will be auditing the course for free so will be able to read and view the course content but not submit projects or earn the certification.

## Assumptions </br>

- The courses will be available for the duration of the semester.
- I have all required software.
- I can skip the Installing and Using Python units.

## Stakeholders </br>

 - Professor - for my grade in class
 - Parents - investing in my education and future success, I want to make them proud
 - Perspective Employers - artifact will be added to my student portfolio which could help with getting a job
 - Myself - to gain knowledge in the computer science field

## Timeline </br>

Weekly Chapters:

 - Chapter One - Why we Program? (3 hours) </br>
	- There are many reasons why we program. Some important and common reasons are:
		- [ to build websites, apps, or maybe even use to acquire data within your career field] 
	- In the first chapter we go over basic hardware and it's main properties
		- The Central Processing Unit: runs the program, aka CPU, and is always wondering "what to do next". A very fast property.
		- Input Devices: include the keyboard, mouse, and touch screen feature
		- Output Devices: include screen, speakers, printer, DVD burner
		- Main Memory: is a fast small temporary storage - lost on reboot- aka RAM
		- Secondary Memory: is a slower large permanent storage - lasts until deleted - disk drive/memory stick
		- Below is a screenshot of a basic outlook on these properties:
